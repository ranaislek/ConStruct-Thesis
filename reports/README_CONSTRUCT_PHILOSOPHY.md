# ConStruct Philosophy: Structural-Only Constraints and Post-Generation Validation

This codebase has been refactored to follow the **ConStruct philosophy** of enforcing only structural constraints during generation and measuring chemical properties post-generation. This enables honest, critical analysis of the gap between structural satisfaction and chemical validity.

## üéØ **ConStruct Philosophy**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Structural-Only Constraints**: Projectors enforce ONLY structural constraints (ring count, ring length, planarity)
2. **No Chemical Enforcement**: Chemical validity (valency, connectivity, atom types) is NOT enforced during generation
3. **Post-Generation Measurement**: Chemical properties are measured separately after generation
4. **Honest Gap Analysis**: This reveals the true relationship between structural and chemical constraints

### **Why This Matters for Your Thesis**

- **Reproducible Results**: Clear separation of structural vs chemical constraints
- **Critical Analysis**: Honest measurement of the gap between structural satisfaction and chemical validity
- **ConStruct Alignment**: Follows the original paper's methodology for planarity experiments
- **Thesis-Ready**: Provides systematic data for analyzing constraint satisfaction vs chemical reality

## üîÑ **Transition Mechanisms**

### **Edge-Deletion Transitions** (`absorbing_edges`)

- **Absorbing State**: No-edge (index 0)
- **Forward Process**: Edges progressively disappear
- **Reverse Process**: Edges are added while preserving constraints
- **Natural Bias**: Toward sparse graphs
- **Constraints**: "At most" (e.g., at most N rings)

### **Edge-Insertion Transitions** (`edge_insertion`)

- **Absorbing State**: Edge (index 1)
- **Forward Process**: Edges progressively appear
- **Reverse Process**: Edges are removed while preserving constraints
- **Natural Bias**: Toward connected graphs
- **Constraints**: "At least" (e.g., at least N rings)

## üèóÔ∏è **Structural Constraints**

### **Ring Count Constraints**

```yaml
# Edge-deletion: "At most N rings"
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_most'
max_rings: 2

# Edge-insertion: "At least N rings"
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_least'
min_rings: 2
```

### **Ring Length Constraints**

```yaml
# Edge-deletion: "All rings at most N length"
rev_proj: 'ring_length_at_most'
max_ring_length: 6

# Edge-insertion: "All rings at least N length"
rev_proj: 'ring_length_at_least'
min_ring_length: 4
```

### **Other Structural Constraints**

```yaml
# Planarity
rev_proj: 'planar'

# Tree structure
rev_proj: 'tree'

# Lobster structure
rev_proj: 'lobster'
```

## üß™ **Post-Generation Validation**

### **Chemical Properties Measured**

- **Valency Violations**: Check if atoms exceed expected valency
- **Connectivity**: Single vs multiple components
- **Atom Type Validity**: Valid atom symbols
- **RDKit Validity**: Molecular structure validation
- **Molecular Descriptors**: Weight, logP, HBD, HBA, etc.

### **Configuration**

```yaml
# Enable post-generation validation
post_gen_validation: True
post_gen_validation_config:
  enable_rdkit: True
  enable_valency_check: True
  enable_connectivity_check: True
```

### **Output Analysis**

The validation provides honest metrics:

```

## üìã **Configuration Examples**

### **Edge-Deletion Example**

```yaml
# configs/model/edge_deletion_example.yaml
transition: 'absorbing_edges'
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_most'
max_rings: 2
post_gen_validation: True
```

### **Edge-Insertion Example**

```yaml
# configs/model/edge_insertion_example.yaml
transition: 'edge_insertion'
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_least'
min_rings: 2
post_gen_validation: True
```

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**

### **1. Choose Your Transition Type**

```bash
# Edge-deletion (sparse graphs, "at most" constraints)
python main.py model=discrete model.transition=absorbing_edges model.rev_proj=ring_count_at_most model.max_rings=2

# Edge-insertion (connected graphs, "at least" constraints)
python main.py model=discrete model.transition=edge_insertion model.rev_proj=ring_count_at_least model.min_rings=2
```

### **2. Enable Post-Generation Validation**

```bash
python main.py model=discrete model.post_gen_validation=True
```

### **3. Run Training**

```bash
python main.py model=discrete dataset=qm9 train.batch_size=32
```

### **4. Generate and Validate**

```bash
python main.py model=discrete dataset=qm9 test=True
```

## üìä **Thesis Analysis Framework**

### **Key Metrics for Analysis**

1. **Structural Satisfaction Rate**: % of graphs satisfying structural constraints
2. **Chemical Validity Rate**: % of graphs that are chemically valid
3. **Gap Analysis**: Difference between structural and chemical satisfaction
4. **Constraint Type Impact**: How different constraints affect chemical validity
5. **Transition Mechanism Impact**: Edge-deletion vs edge-insertion performance

### **Research Questions**

- How well do structural constraints correlate with chemical validity?
- Which constraint types produce the most chemically valid molecules?
- What is the trade-off between structural satisfaction and chemical reality?
- How do different transition mechanisms affect the structural-chemical gap?

## üîç **Validation and Debugging**

### **Transition-Projector Compatibility**

The system automatically validates that you're using compatible transitions and projectors:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Valid: Edge-deletion with "at most" projector
transition: 'absorbing_edges'
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_most'

# ‚úÖ Valid: Edge-insertion with "at least" projector  
transition: 'edge_insertion'
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_least'

# ‚ùå Invalid: Edge-deletion with "at least" projector
transition: 'absorbing_edges'
rev_proj: 'ring_count_at_least'  # Will raise error
```

### **Debugging Tips**

1. **Check Transition Type**: Ensure you're using the right transition for your constraints
2. **Validate Configuration**: Use the compatibility checker
3. **Monitor Validation**: Watch the post-generation validation output
4. **Analyze Gaps**: Focus on the structural-chemical validity gap
